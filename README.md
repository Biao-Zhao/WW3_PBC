**Double-Periodic Boundary Conditions in Modified PR3 Scheme**

This version of WaveWatch III (WW3) introduces a modification to the PR3 scheme, enabling support for double-periodic boundary conditions in a configuration based on Cartesian coordinates and rectangular model grids. This modification is specifically designed for idealized experiments, facilitating rapid wave growth over an infinite wind fetch while significantly reducing computational demands. For more detailed information about the implementation and usage, please refer to the related documentation or publication:
