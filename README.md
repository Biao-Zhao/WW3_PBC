By modifying the PR3 scheme, this version of WW3 supports double-periodic boundary conditions in Cartesian coordinates and rectangular grids. This modification is designed for idealized experiments, ensuring rapid wave growth and significantly reducing computational demands. For detailed information, one can refer to:
